"# GameEngine" 

There are several example "run_game.bat" batch files in "D:\Pre_030119_Folders\GameEngine\Game_Engine_Class\CSC4903\DavisJonathanGame\".

Edit any of them and make sure that the path to the CSC4903 folder is correct.

Then, open a command prompt in that directory and type "run_game[number].bat [driver letter]".

For additional information and instructions, please see the README.txt included in that directory.
